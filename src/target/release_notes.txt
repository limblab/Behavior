Releaes notes for target code.  Should be updated for each new major or minor

Version 1.4

    itself when working on multiple branches.
Ball Drop
  * Fixed a bug that caused the reward counter not to reset correctly.

Version 2.0
===========

General
  * Merged the graphics and target code into a single repository to support 
    simultanious releases.
Graphics
  * Changed the name of the application and source tree from DXCheck to 
    BehaviorGraphics.

  * Added tabs for working versions or ball-drop and wrist-flexion tasks.
  * Added controlls for delay parameter in random walk and target angle cycling
    in bump-stim tasks (See: below).
Ball Drop
  * Fixed a bug that prevent correct display of the incompletes counter.
Bump-Stim
  * Added a parameter to allow the angle at which the targets are displayed to 
    cycle through random values.  Set parameter to zero to use the requested
