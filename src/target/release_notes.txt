      Now: (WORD_END_TRIAL | WORD_INCOMPLETE_END_CODE) => 0x20 | 0x03 => 0x23
Graphics
  * The settings and model file dialogs now have independent most recent locations
    (Load model will always default to the last model location and vice-versa)
  * The titlebar now updates to reflect the currently loaded settings file.
  * The titlebar now appends an asterisk to the filename to reflect unsaved modifications.
